I have heard what the talkers were talking, the talk of the  
 beginning and the end. But I do not talk of the beginning or the end. There was never any more inception than there is now, Nor any more youth or age than there is now, And will never be any more perfection than there is now, Nor any more heaven or hell than there is now.

Urge and urge and urge, Always the procreant urge of the world.  
 Out of the dimness opposite equals advance, always substance and  
 increase, Always a knit of identity, always distinction, always a breed of life. To elaborate is no avail, learn’d and unlearn’d feel that it is  
 so.
